# ALX Listing App

The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.
